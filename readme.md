# Authorization Test Server and Scripts

This repo contains:
- A Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and nginx support and config files to create a container against which to test web authorization scripts or clients.
- Example scripts to authenticate to this server

I set up a public server at http://authtest.midnightfreddie.com/ so you may run the client scripts against my server.
